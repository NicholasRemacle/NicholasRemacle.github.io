        <h4> Biography </h4>
    <p> Ever since I was in elementary school I've always been extremely invested in and motivated by stories. I learned a lot of lessons through them and largely found the type of person I wanted to be through them as well. This was mostly through books at the time, but as I got into middle school and high school it expanded to games especially. Playing games and experiencing the stories they have to share, the experiences and memories I gained from them, played a large part into me becoming the person I am now. I learned that I want to be someone who can inspire people in one way or another. I've always been interested in music and art as well. I've played bass guitar since I was in fifth grade and have considered art in an ever expanding myriad of mediums a main hobby and focus of mine since sixth grade. Both interests played into my desire to inspire people, through music or art, and my interest in games and the emotions that have been invoked in me through them led me to desire to be a part of something that invokes similar sensations in others as well. I hope to eventually be a part of a creative team that allows me to contribute to experiences that leave consumers feeling real emotions, whether it be awe, happiness, sadness, or something more complex and thought-provoking. This portfolio is with the intent to show my abilities and how I can potentially contribute to a team where that hope becomes a reality.</p>
